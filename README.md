# 6.857-PSET-1

To run the decrpytion algorithm, clone the repo and run:
```shell
python main.py
```

You can also change line `7` in `main.py` with the appropriate percent of the cipher text you would like to use for decryption. For instance:
```python
ciphertext_data_input = CipherText(0.35)
```
will use the first 35% of the cipher text for decryption.
